### Verify Your Setup

The work you’ve completed so far will ensure that you are ready to hit the ground running on day one.

There's one step left: verifying that you've got everything set up or installed properly. To do so, you will take screenshots of the tools you need for class and upload them in a zipped folder.  If you encountered any errors while installing tools, please take a screenshot of the errors you encountered and include them in this folder. Instructional staff will be ready to help troubleshoot errors when the course starts. To take your screenshots and upload your folder, complete the following steps:

1. Create a folder on your desktop called `Class_Requirements`.

2. Then, take screenshots of the following tools, installations, etc., and save them in the `Class_Requirements` folder. You can always refer back to Modules 1 and 2 to verify where to find the information about either your machine or the installs.

    1. Screenshot of your machine's CPU, RAM, and available free space.
    2. Screenshot of Slack installed and open on your machine.
    3. Screenshot of Zoom installed and open on your machine.
    4. Screenshot of your GitHub profile.

3. After you have all of your screenshots saved in your `Class_Requirements` folder, zip the entire folder and upload it by following the instructions below.
