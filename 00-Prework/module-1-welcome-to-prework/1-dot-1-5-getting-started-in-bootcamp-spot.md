To participate in this course, you need to know a few basic things about Bootcamp Spot, the learning platform we'll be using. You'll learn more about this system as you progress through the course, and you can consult the official Canvas documentation for more information. But for now, here's what you need to know:

*   How to navigate Bootcamp Spot
*   How to submit your assignments
*   How to update your profile in Bootcamp Spot and add your picture (We'll cover this part in the Set Up Your Profile section.)

## Navigating Bootcamp Spot

Bootcamp Spot navigation consists of global navigation, course navigation, and module navigation.

*   **Global navigation** is used to access your Account/Profile, Dashboard, Courses list, and Calendar. Global navigation is found on the left-hand side of the screen, listed from top to bottom.

*   **Course navigation** is used to move between the different areas of your course, like Syllabus, Modules, Slack, Grades, and People. Course navigation is found just to the right of the global navigation and can be collapsed for more screen space.

*   **Module navigation** is used to move through your course content. You can access specific items in the modules, see a module overview from the Modules page, or move to Previous/Next items at the bottom of each page.
