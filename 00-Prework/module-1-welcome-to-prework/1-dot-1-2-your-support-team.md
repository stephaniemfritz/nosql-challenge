Completing this boot camp will be both rewarding and demanding. It won't always be easy. At times, you might find yourself working extra hard to learn a new concept. This can be frustrating, but know that these are the times when you can actually learn the most!

The important thing to remember is that you are not alone. You and all of the other students in your cohort will have a full team of talented professionals ready to help you at every step of the journey.

## Academic Team

The academic team will assist directly with anything related to coursework. The team consists of instructional staff dedicated directly to your class as well as your Student Success Advisor and support team. Each class has a dedicated academic team that will guide you through the experience. You'll spend a lot of time with this team while you complete your boot camp.

*   **Instructor** - Your instructor is the lead facilitator of your learning experience. They manage the live class sessions and office hours. They also monitor your progress in the course, providing feedback and assistance to help you reach your goals.

*   **Teaching Assistants (TAs)** - Depending on the size of your class, you may also have TAs to provide support and troubleshooting. TAs will support your instructor by helping provide critical feedback and evaluation that will ensure that you understand the concepts being covered and how they relate to previous material. TAs are actively engaged and supportive during your regularly scheduled office hours, ensuring you receive the assistance you need.

*   **Learning Assistants** - You will have access to a team of learning assistants on Slack. When you can't quite find the answer to one of your questions, you can submit it via an automated Slackbot that will pass your questions to the learning assistants. A learning assistant will reply to questions one at a time to help you and other students get an answer.

*   **Xpert Learning Assistant** - The Xpert Learning Assistant is an AI Learning Assistant accessible via your course navigation, offering instant answers, quizzes on coding concepts, and invaluable assistance, ensuring you're equipped and prepared for every step of your boot camp journey.

*   **Tutoring** - Tutoring is a free service that's available after you've exhausted all other resources. It is not a primary source of support and will only help if you're already devoting many hours per week to coding practice and study. Tutors on the team are either a boot camp graduate, a TA or substitute TA, or have relevant industry experience. The one thing every tutor has in common is firsthand knowledge of both the challenges of learning to code and the boot camp. Every tutor has a genuine desire to help you and to make your boot camp experience a little easier.

*   **Student Success Advisor** - The Student Success Advisor (SSA) will guide you through the course from the time you enroll until the day you graduate. They'll support you every step of the way. That means answering your questions, offering encouragement, or simply cheering you on. They can also help you find support specific to your needs to help you reach your goals.

## Career Team

The Career Team will help you build the job-search skills necessary to achieve your post boot camp goals. They offer frequent online career events, including recent graduates offering job search advice, experienced tech industry professionals sharing insights and expertise, and behavioral and technical job interview practice.

Your Career Materials Advisor will provide you with individualized feedback on your job search materials (resume, LinkedIn profile, GitHub).

Your Career Coach will help you to navigate the job search process by hosting open office hours and 1:1 meetings with you to discuss goals and help you prepare for the job search.
