To successfully use the tools and technologies required in this course, you need the right equipment. You will need a Mac or PC computer that has 8GB RAM memory, a dual-core processor (64-bit, no 32-bit), and at least 64 GB of available hard drive space.

> **note**
>
> Linux OS cannot be used in this course.

## Check your Mac Requirements

If you're using a Mac computer for this boot camp, it needs to run macOS 10.9 Mavericks or later, which should have a 64-bit processor.

> **note**
>
> 64-bit processors have been standard in all Mac products since 2009 with macOS 10.6 Snow Leopard.

To check your device specifications on a Mac, follow these steps:

1.  Click the Apple icon in the top left of the menu bar.

    *   The processor
    *   Memory

    The computer in the following example is running macOS 10.14.6 Mojave with a 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of memory.

## Check Your Windows Requirements

> **important**

> If you're using a PC for this boot camp, it must be running Windows 8.1 or later.

To check your device specifications on Windows, follow these steps:

1.  Click your Windows Settings and select “System.”

3.  In the System settings, click “About.”

![The Windows Setting screen.](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/prework/m1/img/data-pre-1-4-5-settings-click-system-about.jpg)

Under the “Device specifications” heading and “System type” subheading it will say "64-bit operating system, x64-based processor", which means you're covered!

![The Windows About screen.](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/prework/m1/img/data-pre-1-4-6-settings-click-system-device-specifications.jpg)

Or, you can type **About** in the Windows 10 search box, which will open the window above.
