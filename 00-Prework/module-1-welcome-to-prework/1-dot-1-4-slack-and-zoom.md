You'll use two tools to communicate with your classmates and instructional team throughout the course: Slack and Zoom. You'll learn more about these tools during your Welcome class, when you'll get your first Zoom experience and gain access to your Slack workspace.

## Slack

Slack is the shared, virtual workspace where your class will interact during and outside of class hours. Slack will facilitate regular communication to create a collaborative learning environment, which is essential for this class. In Slack you can share helpful articles, relevant tips, and study group details, or even create new channels, or forums, for study groups.

We will use Slack to send code snippets during class, relay important announcements, and facilitate group exercises. You will receive the link to your class-specific channel during orientation. Though there is a Slack web client, for this course you should have the program installed on your machine.

Slack works on your computer and your phone, as shown in the following image:

For more information about Slack, read the [official guide](https://slack.com/help/categories/360000049043).

### How to Make the Most of Slack

Slack can be a powerful tool for collaboration and learning. Use the following guidelines to get the most out of using it.

Do enable notifications using the [Settings gear at the top of each channel](https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications): How to Set Up Slack Notifications

*   **Do** make sure to download the Slack app for your Desktop rather than using the web app.

*   **Do** use #04-learning-assistant channel for getting help outside of class/office hours.

*   **Do** respond in threads. This organizes conversations and makes the Slack workspace much less cluttered.

    *   To respond in a thread, point your cursor to a message, then click the chat bubble in the menu that appears to the right:

> **note**

> To the left of the chat bubble is an emoji menu!

*   Remember, you can create your own channels by clicking the + sign to the right of the Channels list on Slack. This is a great way to connect with your peers through study groups.

*   Do NOT send direct messages to TAs for technical support or post publicly asking for TAs to contact or meet with you. Leverage the centralized team of Learning Assistants via the learning-assistant channel on Slack and attend scheduled Office Hours run by TAs.

## Zoom

Your weekly Live Sessions will be held in the Zoom web conferencing software. With Zoom, you can see and chat with your instructor and classmates, both over video and in a text chatroom.

## Quick Tips

*   Make sure your microphone is muted when youâ€™re not speaking.
*   Keep your camera on throughout class to ensure clear communication.
*   Use your preferred full name as your Zoom name.
*   Particpate in any polls that your instructor uses to gauge how class is going.

You can also use non-verbal cues by doing things like raising and lowering your hand. You can find these options if you click on Participants.
