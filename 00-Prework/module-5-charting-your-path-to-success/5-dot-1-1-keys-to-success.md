Success in this course depends on how you approach it. This boot camp will be challenging, but by setting realistic expectations, you’ll be prepared to overcome any difficulties that may arise. As you prepare for class, consider the following tips and suggestions.

## Be Committed

Learning data analysis and visualization requires diligence, practice, and a desire to improve. These are things that can’t be taught in a classroom—that effort must come from you.

In addition to reading the course content and completing the activities and projects, you will need to put in additional hours of independent practice every week. With that in mind, try to set aside time for extra practice in advance. This will help you stick to a schedule and manage your time.

Data analysis is not a spectator sport. That is, it’s not a skill that can be learned by simply reading, watching, or following along. This might be intimidating at first, but remember that making mistakes is part of the process. You will make mistakes, but with each problem you solve, you’ll add another instrument to your data toolkit. So don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty!

## Be Compassionate (Toward Yourself)

When you work with data, it usually involves putting your head down, coming up with solutions to difficult problems, wrangling large datasets, and constantly learning new tools and paradigms. It’s this hard work that makes each victory so satisfying, but it also means that most of a data professional’s time is spent feeling “in between” victories, struggling to come up with solutions. This feeling can be discouraging, and it can even make you think that everyone else “gets it” and you don’t. This feeling has a name: [imposter syndrome](https://caitlinhudon.com/2018/01/19/imposter-syndrome-in-data-science/).

Everyone has struggles and frustrations with data, no matter their expertise. This is a huge field, and everyone is going to have areas where they excel and others where they struggle. Fight against the temptation to compare yourself to others. Don’t downplay your strengths while focusing only on your weaknesses. Remember that you are in a safe space to make mistakes. The fact that you want to be in this boot camp is the best indicator that you belong here.

## Be Collaborative

No matter your level of knowledge coming into this boot camp, remember that every student is going through the same experience. Many of you will have similar doubts and fears, and hopes and expectations. This boot camp is about more than just technical skills. It’s also a chance to build the type of community that you’ll need to succeed as a data professional.

As you work through the course, follow these tips:

*   Reach out to other students to form real or virtual study groups (using Zoom).
*   Create channels in Slack to discuss concepts and ideas for applications.
*   Leverage your classmates’ knowledge in addition to the support team you already have.

Although you’ll complete some of the work for this class on your own, you’ll also work together to achieve success. You’ll learn how to walk someone through your logic, to talk through your thought processes out loud, and to explain your code and establish solutions with a team. Any professional role you take after the boot camp will require a great deal of teamwork, so treat this as an opportunity to work on your soft skills as you develop those data chops.

Collaborating to find solutions is a major part of working as a data professional. In addition to group projects, you’ll have opportunities in the virtual classes to pair up with other students to complete activities and think through concepts; for example, you’ll participate in pair programming, a common technique in [agile development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) where one student writes code, or “drives,” while another reviews it in real time, or “navigates.” Take advantage of these opportunities as enthusiastically as you can: they are great experiences for you to discuss during job interviews down the line.

As you’ll soon find out, the collaboration extends well beyond your classmates and this program. You are part of a larger data community that exists online, where data professionals ask questions, get feedback, discuss solutions, and learn new ideas. The online forum [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), as just one example, is an open community for coders to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.

One of the biggest advantages of the boot camp setting is the network of fellow data professionals that you’ll build. Your classmates will become hiring managers or employees of companies looking for more data professionals in the future. Now is the perfect time to get to know one another. The community of learning that you build in this boot camp will provide a bridge to your future endeavors. The strength of that bridge is largely up to how much effort you put into its construction.

## Use the Resources Available to You

Remember that you have a lot of support resources available to you as part of this course. Don’t be afraid to do the following:

* consult with your SSA, instructor, or TA

* attend office hours

* submit questions to Learning Assistants using AskBCS

* use the Xpert Learning Assistant to answer detailed questions about the course material, point you in the right direction to solve a problem, assist in debugging, or create quizzes and flashcards

* schedule a tutoring session

These resources are meant to help you navigate this course successfully&mdash;be sure to use them!

## Be Career Minded

In this course, you’ll gain the technical knowledge, valuable soft skills, and professional development needed to stand out with employers. Whether you want to advance where you are or find your next employer, you’ll have what it takes to be a strong candidate. Your Boot Camp Career Team will empower you with the tools, resources, and support you need to compete in your field. They have talked with thousands of employers, and they know exactly what those employers are looking for in top candidates.

Remember that the time to make connections doesn’t start after your class ends. It begins the first time you attend a virtual class, the first time you attend a meetup group, or at your first tech event. Who you know really does make a difference—not only in terms of potential job opportunities but also the chance to learn from those with different perspectives and experiences.
