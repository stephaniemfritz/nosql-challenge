## Overview of Databases

Data needs to live somewhere—and that’s where databases come in. SQL, pronounced "sequel" and short for Structured Query Language, is the standard language for working with databases, whether it’s storing data, transforming it, or retrieving it. Anyone who works with data needs to know SQL.

You’ll learn the standard process for getting data, cleaning it up, and storing it, which is known as Extract-Transform-Load, or ETL. You’ll also learn how to use SQL and create your own API endpoints. An API endpoint is the location that allows two software programs to communicate with each other. Specific roles that focus on SQL are data engineers, ETL developers, and database administrators.

## Connection to the Data Pipeline

In the data pipeline, every tool available to us depends on having reliable data. Databases and database languages are used not just to store data, but to extract it from various sources and serve it to the analysis tools that need it. Databases make sure that multiple users can access data at the same time without sacrificing data integrity.
