## Overview of Visualization

All of the analysis in the world, no matter how accurate or sophisticated, is useless if it cannot be communicated. Data visualizations allow us to tell a story with data in a way that is clear, accessible, and cohesive. Visualizations allow even those with limited data fluency to interpret data.

In this course, youâ€™ll use web frameworks (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) as well as Tableau to create interactive data visualizations. This skill is essential in the field of data analytics, especially for business intelligence analysts, data visualization engineers, and Tableau developers.

## Connection to the Data Pipeline

In the data pipeline, data visualization is how information is given to end-users. It can be used to understand raw data, present analysis of the data, and monitor analytics in an organization. Interactivity in data visualizations also allows end-users to do some of their own basic analysis, even without an analytic background.
