## Overview of Big Data and Machine Learning

Later in the course, we’ll focus on how to make data work for you. First, we’ll cover the statistical programming language R and delve into statistics. We’ll also review big data frameworks like Hadoop and tools such as PySpark, which help solve challenges related to storing and working with large amounts of data.

These topics lead into the part of the course on machine learning, when you’ll create algorithms that learn how to solve problems—without explicit instructions—by analyzing and learning from large amounts of data.

The skills you learn in this section of the course are essential for jobs such as statistical programmers, data engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists.

## Connection to the Data Pipeline

Statistics, big data, and machine learning are all used to perform sophisticated analyses to solve problems that were until recently thought impossible to solve. These advanced techniques rely on the latest cutting-edge research, and groundbreaking insights are being discovered every day.
