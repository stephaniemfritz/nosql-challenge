## Overview of Excel

The first part of the course focuses on Excel and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Excel is the data professional’s scratch paper. VBA is a programming language that automates tasks and extends the functionality of Excel. If you can use these tools well, you’ll be able to perform powerful analyses and create compelling visualizations.

In this course, you’ll learn how to do tasks in spreadsheets that you may have never thought possible. Excel and VBA are used extensively in industries like finance, marketing, and human resources by data analysts and VBA developers.

You’ll also be introduced to GitHub, a collaborative version-control tool used by coders and data professionals all over the world. In this course, you’ll use GitHub to store and share your data projects.

## Connection to the Data Pipeline

In the data pipeline, Excel is used primarily for exploratory data analysis and visualization. Using VBA with Excel makes it possible to perform data validation and advanced data analysis. However, the only way to share data using Excel is to send an Excel file, which can be inconvenient if multiple people need to access the data at the same time. Therefore, other tools are used to store and share data.

VBA is powerful, but there are other programming languages with special features that handle advanced data wrangling and analysis like machine learning.
