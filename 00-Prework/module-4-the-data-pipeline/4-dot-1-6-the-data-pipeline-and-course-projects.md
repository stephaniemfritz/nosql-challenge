## Overview of Course Projects

In the projects in this course, you will apply the skills you learn by choosing a real-life problem to solve. You’ll gather real-world data, perform an analysis, create a visualization, and present your findings. Your projects will be great portfolio pieces that you can showcase to potential employers.

## Connection to the Data Pipeline

Your projects will use different aspects of the data pipeline. You'll extract data, store it, perform exploratory data analysis, and validate the data. You’ll come up with your own research questions, wrangle the data to fit your needs, perform data analysis, and build machine learning models. Finally, you'll create data visualizations to share with the world.
