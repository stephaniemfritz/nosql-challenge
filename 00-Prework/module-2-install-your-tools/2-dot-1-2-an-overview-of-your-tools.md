This section provides an overview of your tools to help you better understand their role in the course.

## Google Chrome

This is the web browser we'll use to quickly determine whether our code is working. Google Chrome has a number of tools that make it an ideal platform for data analytics, so if you are currently using a different browser, you're encouraged to use Chrome for this class.

## Microsoft Excel

You'll learn the ins and outs of Microsoft Excel during the first few weeks of the course. If you don't have access to Excel, a [one-month free trial](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) of the latest version of Excel is available from Microsoft. Before completing your purchase, make sure that you've selected the correct operating system and version.

> **note**
>
> The web version of Excel is not sufficient for this course.

## Git and GitHub

Code files are largely collaborative, as developers are constantly building on each other's work. Git is a version-control system that offers a specialized set of strategies for orchestrating this collaboration, and GitHub stores these collaborative actions online. You can think of GitHub as a sort of Dropbox for coders. It offers a central place for developers to upload their code, view revision history, and make changes to a main set of files. You'll come to learn a lot about Git and GitHub in your first week of class. You will receive the link to your class-specific repository near the start of your first class. A repository is a place to store project files. This repository contains a history of all changes made to the repository.

## Git Bash and Terminal

Git Bash (for Windows users) and Terminal (for Mac users) offer a command-line interface for working with the files and folders on your computer. It's similar to Finder or Windows Explorer, but without pictures or visuals. It's just a box with text. So, why would you want to use a command-line interface? Over time, you'll come to understand that, in many situations, using a command-line interface can be faster and more effective than relying on the operating system's graphical user interface (GUI). You'll get plenty of exposure to the command line at the beginning of the course.

## Homebrew (Mac Only)

Homebrew is a Mac-specific tool kit that makes it easy to install a variety of applications using the command line. It can greatly simplify the installation process for various tools you'll be using throughout your career.

## GitHub Tokens

Generating a token allows developers to interface with certain remote services without having to constantly enter login information. You will generate a personal access token for GitHub.

Compared to password authentication, tokens offer numerous security benefits. For one thing, they are unique and random, helping to prevent brute force attacks. We can also limit their scope depending on needs, and we can revoke them individually without updating other credentials.

## VS Code

Visual Studio (VS) Code is a free text editor that runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems. For developers, text editors are like a blank canvas where they can draft their work.

At a fundamental level, programming is all about creating text in files with various extensions. When we create a block of HTML like the one below, what we've really done is created a block of text. There may be some unfamiliar syntax in there, but at its most basic level, it's just text.

For a simple text editor, this is where the comprehension stops: our block of HTML remains a block of text. But for more powerful text editors like VS Code, these blocks of text are immediately recognized as code (as long as we include the right file extension). VS Code can provide a more visually intuitive understanding of the code through indicative coloring, smart tabs, and autocomplete functionality. As a result, creating HTML is a more natural process, and the HTML can be debugged more quickly.
