This course will expose you to a wide range of tools, some or all of which may be new to you. In this section, you'll get acquainted with each of these tools and then review the processes for installing them on your machine.

Install the following tools on or before your first class:

*   Google Chrome
*   Slack
*   Microsoft Excel

> **note**
>
> If you do not have access to Excel, a [one-month free trial](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) of the latest version of Excel is available from Microsoft. **You should not start your free trial until the first day of class** to allow for continuous access to Excel during the first unit of the course. The web version of Excel will not be sufficient for this course.

*   Git and GitHub
*   Git Bash (Windows only) and Terminal (Mac only; preinstalled)
*   Homebrew (Mac only)
*   GitHub Token
*   VS Code

You should also create accounts on the following websites:

*   LinkedIn
*   GitHub
*   Stack Overflow

If you encounter any issues during setup, don't worry. Your instructional staff will help you troubleshoot any errors and answer your questions on the first day of class.
