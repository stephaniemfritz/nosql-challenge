## 13.3: ETL Mini Project Day 3

### Overview

Today's class is the third and final day of the ETL mini project!

### Class Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

* Create an entity relationship diagram from CSV files.

* Import CSV files into a postgreSQL database.

* Discuss the benefits and challenges of the ETL process.

### Instructor Notes

Your project week may have been shifted due to a holiday; if so, the students will have less time to work on projects today.

You can remind the students that there are office hours before and after class that may be used for extended project-work time.

Alternatively, team members are welcome to collaborate on their projects outside of class.

The students will use today's class to wrap up their ETL mini projects.

The solution for the ETL mini project can be found [here](Activities/01-Ins_ETL_Mini_Project/Solution/).

Today's class will end with a discussion of the projects.

Remember that this project, like the other projects in this course, must be graded by you and your fellow instructional team members.
